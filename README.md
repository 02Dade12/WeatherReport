# WeatherReport

Welcome to my repository! This repo was created to show case my ability to work with multiple coding languages including HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Javascript, & jQuery.

I used OpenWeatherMaps API in order to build a web application that will allow a user to search the current weather conditions for a particular city. The future five day forecase will appear at the bottom of the page and the most recent searched will be saved under the search bar for easy access.
